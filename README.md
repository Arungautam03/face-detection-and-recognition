# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at building a face recognition system using OpenCV and Python. The system is capable of detecting faces in images and recognizing individuals based on a pre-defined dataset of face images.

## Features

- Detect faces in images using Haar cascades.
- Recognize individuals using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognition algorithm.
- Train the face recognizer using a dataset of face images.
- Save the trained model for future use.

## Usage
- Prepare your dataset of face images. Organize the images into folders, with each folder representing a different person. Ensure that the images are named appropriately and follow a consistent naming convention.

- Train the face recognizer using the classify.py script:
- After training, the trained model will be saved as classifier.yml.
- Run the face recognition system using the recognize.py script to recognize faces
